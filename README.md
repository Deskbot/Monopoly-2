Monopoly 2
==========

An improved alternative rule-set for Monopoly. Implemented in English.

Written in markdown. Exports to HTML and PDF.

Features
--------

* Faster than Monopoly 1
* More fun to use than Monopoly 1

Installation
------------

Download:

`git clone https://github.com/Deskbot/Monopoly-2`

Required Packages:

* pandoc
* wkhtmltopdf (requires QT patch i.e. the directly downloaded binary files copied into /usr/bin instead of using a package manager)

Version
-------

Current version: *2.3*

Any time a rule is changed, I'm increasing the version by 0.1. This is only really useful for people who check back and see that there are more commits, but want to know immediately whether those commits have changed any rules rather than just wording or grammar.
